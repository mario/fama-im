[Task] Replace tapioca with libempathy
[Task[ Implement connect differently
	- /connect user_id
	- command line ">" disappears, and "Password:" prompt appears
	- user enters password, password is hidden
	- user clicks enter, and then wwe handle connection
[Task] Implement commands history (cycled with down arrow)
	- ~/.fama/history
	- history saving - option in ~/.fama/config
	- number of commands saved - option in ~/.fama/config
	- Should be configurable through Fama UI
[Task] Implement aliases
	- Current implementation has problems in way that 
          you cant have two accounts with same id's, even
	  if they are different protocols
	- Implement aliases in the following way:
		- add alias as optional parametar to /account add
		- if user adds an account with non-existing UI without 
		  alias, allow him to do so
		- if user tries to add an account without alias, and 
		  that id is already used, inform him that he has
                  to use an alias
		- provide a facility to manipulate aliases from fama UI
		- ~/.fama/aliases

[Task] Contact list name sorting
	- When CL is sorted via status, contacts with the same status 
          should be sorted by name.

[Bug] Shortcuts are implemented in a bad way [Delete, Backspace, and 
such don't work for some]
